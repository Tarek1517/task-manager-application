# 📝 Task Manager Application

A simple and responsive task manager built with **Vue 3**, **Pinia**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It allows users to:

- ✅ Add new tasks  
- 🗂️ Filter tasks (All / Completed / Incomplete)  
- ✔️ Mark tasks as complete/incomplete  
- 🗑️ Delete tasks  

Tasks are stored in **localStorage**, so they persist across sessions.  
This project is lightweight and ideal for learning Vue 3 state management and basic UI interactivity.
